1. Use codes and txt files in test-percolation to auto-simulate percolation process.
2. If you only consider use only one Weighted Quick Union Union Find (WQUUF) object with two virtual
sites TOP and BOTTOM  to determine whether it is percolated, there will be backwash problem which means
when the top and bottom connect, some sites which connect only to bottom will also be FULL, this is wrong.
we have two approches to solve this problem.
